I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Stanford in the mathematics department. Prior, I was a undergraduate at Columbia. [Here](../assets/files/Benjamin_Church_CV.pdf) is my CV.

My interests are mostly in algebraic geomery, arithmetic geometry, high energy astrophysics, and logic.
If you have questions about my work or writing, feel free to email me at bvchurch + at + stanford.edu.
