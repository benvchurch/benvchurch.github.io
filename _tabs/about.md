I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Stanford in the mathematics department. Prior, I was a undergraduate at Columbia.

My interests are mostly in algebraic geomery, arithmetic geometry, high energy astrophysiscs, and logic.
If you have questions about my work or writing, feel free to email me at bvchurch + at + stanford.edu.
