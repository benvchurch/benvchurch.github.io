Groups
======

A group $G$ is a set with a binary operation $\circ$ which satisfies,

1.  associativity, $x \circ (y \circ z) = (x \circ y) \circ z$

2.  there exists an identity $e \in G$ such that
    $e \circ g = g \circ e = g$ for any $g \in G$

3.  for each $g \in G$ there exists an inverse $g^{-1} \in G$ such that
    $g \circ g^{-1} = g^{-1} \circ g = e$

The following are groups,

1.  the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ with addition $+$

2.  the nonzero rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}^\times$ with multiplication
    $\cdot$

3.  invertable matrices with matrix multiplication

4.  the permutations of a set with composition of functions

We say that $(G, \circ)$ is *abelian* if $\circ$ is commutative,
$x \circ y = y \circ x$. In this case we usually write $x + y$ for the
binary operation, $0$ for $e$ and $-x$ for $x^{-1}$ in analogy with the
case of integers.

A group $G$ is *finitely generated* if there exists a finite set
$S \subset G$ such that every element in $g \in G$ can be expressed as a
finite combination of elements of $S$ (and the inverses of elements in
$S$) i.e. $g = s_1 \circ \cdots \circ s_n$ for
$s_1, \dots, s_n \in S \cup S^{-1}$ where
$S^{-1} = \{ s^{-1} \mid s \in S \}$.

The following are groups,

1.  the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are generated by one element, namely $1$
    so finitely generated.

2.  the nonzero rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}^\times$ with multiplication
    $\cdot$ are not finitely generated since there are infinitely many
    prime numbers

3.  invertable matrices with matrix multiplication are not finitely
    generated because they contain diagonal matrices with
    $\mathbb{Q}^\times$ entries and these special matrices cannot be
    finitely generated by the above reason

4.  the permutations of a finite are finite in number and thus are
    obviously finitely generated.

Notice that the notion of begin finitely generated is vacuous for finite
groups.

A group that will be very important for us is the modular group
$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is defined the group of matrices with
integer coefficients and determinant one,
$$\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})= \left\{ \begin{pmatrix}
a & b
\\
c & d
\end{pmatrix} \quad \middle| \quad a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and } ad - bc = 1  \right\}$$

The modular group is finitely generated with two generators,
$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1
\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\quad \quad \quad
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & - 1
\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\end{aligned}$$

Excercise for you.

If we have a group $G$ and a subgroup $H \subset G$ we would like a way
to construct a smaller group by "sending $H$ to zero." We acomplish this
by quotienting. However, we can only do this under the technical
condition that the subgroup be normal.

Let $H \subset G$ be a normal subgroup (meaning that
$g H g^{-1} \subset G$ for any $g \in G$) then we define,
$$G / H = \{ g H \mid g \in G \}$$ We call these sets $g H$ cosets of
$H$. Then they form a group via $g_1 H \cdot g_2 H = g_1 g_2 H$, one can
show that this operation is well-defined exactly when $H$ is normal in
$G$. We define the index of $H$ in $G$ to be the size of this group,
$[G : H] = |G / H|$.

Modular arithmetic modulo $n$, taking the numbers $0, 1, \dots, n-1$ and
adding via "clock arithmetic" where $n$ maps back around to $n$ is
accomplished via taking the subgroup of multiples of $n$ in the integers
$n \mathbb{Z}\subset \mathbb{Z}$ and quotienting to get
$\mathbb{Z}/ n \mathbb{Z}$. This group has $n$ elements so we say
$[\mathbb{Z}: n \mathbb{Z}] = n$.

Fields
======

A field is an object that has the same algebraic structure as the
rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ or the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ or the
complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. It is a structure were we can add,
subtract, multiply, and divide. In fields we can consider polynomials
and if they have solutions. We will now give a formal definition.

Holomorphic Functions
---------------------

A subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ is a domain if $\Omega$ is open and
connected.

A map $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ is *holomorphic* at $z \in \Omega$ if
the limit, $$f'(z) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ f(z + h) - f(z) }{h}$$
exists. The map $f$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ if it is holomorphic at
each $z \in \Omega$.

We say a map $f : \mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ is *entire* if it is
holomorphic on all of $\mathbb{C}$.

Let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic at $z \in \Omega$. Then
we may write $f$ as a function of two real variables as,
$f(x, y) = f(x + i y)$. This done,
$$f'(z) = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} = \frac{1}{i} \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}}$$
and thus,
$$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} + i \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} - i \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} \right] \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\bar{z}}} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} + i \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} \right]$$
Therefore, if $f$ is holomorphic then
$$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}} = f'(z) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\bar{z}}} = 0$$

If we write $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ in real form i.e. as a function
$F : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ with $F(x,y) = (A(x,y), B(x,y))$ and
$f(x + iy) = A(x,y) + i B(x,y)$ then,
$$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\bar{z}}} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} + i \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{\partial{A}}{\partial{x}} + i \frac{\partial{B}}{\partial{x}} + i \frac{\partial{A}}{\partial{y}} - \frac{\partial{B}}{\partial{y}} \right]$$
Therefore,
$$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\bar{z}}} = 0 \iff \frac{\partial{A}}{\partial{x}} = \frac{\partial{B}}{\partial{y}} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial{B}}{\partial{x}} = - \frac{\partial{A}}{\partial{y}}$$
These are known as the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We will see that
satisfying these equations along with some weak regularity is necessary
and sufficient for a function to be holomorphic.

Let $\Omega$ be a domain and $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$. Then the
following are equivalent,

1.  $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic.

2.  $f$ is differentiable with continous derivative and,
    $$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\bar{z}}} = 0$$

3.  around the boundary of any disc $D \subset \Omega$ we have,
    $$\oint_{\partial D} f(z) \: \mathrm{d}z \: = 0$$

Let $\Omega$ be a domain and $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$. Then the
following are equivalent,

1.  $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic.

2.  $f \in \mathcal{C}^{1} \left( \Omega \right)$ and
    $$\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\bar{z}}} = 0$$

3.  $f \in \mathcal{C}^{1} \left( \Omega \right)$ and for
    $D \subseteq \Omega$ with piecewise
    $\mathcal{C}^{1} \left( \Omega \right)$ boundary we have
    $$\oint_{\partial D} f(z) \: \mathrm{d}z \: = 0$$

4.  $\forall B_{r}(w) \subsetneq \Omega$ we have,
    $$f(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\partial B_{r}(w)} \frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta - z} \: \mathrm{d}\zeta \:$$
    for all $z \in B_r(w)$.

5.  $f$ is complex analytic: $\forall w  \in \Omega : \exists r > 0$
    such that whenever $|z - w| < r$ we have,
    $$f(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_n(x - w)^n$$

Let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic, for any disc
$D \subset \Omega$ and $w \in D^\circ$ we have,
$$f^{(n)}(w) = \frac{n !}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\partial D} \frac{f(z)}{(z - w)^{n+1}} \: \mathrm{d}z \:$$
In particular, the coefficients of the series expansion about $w$ are,
$$a_n = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\partial D} \frac{f(z)}{(z - w)^{n+1}} \: \mathrm{d}z \:$$

For any $z_0 \in \Omega$, either $f \equiv 0$ in a neighborhood of $z_0$
or we can express $f = (z - z_0)^n u(z)$ for $u(z)$ holomorphic and
$u(z) \neq 0$.

In a neighborhood of $z_0$, we can write,
$$f(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty n_n(z - z_0)^n$$ Either $c_n = 0$ for each
$n$ so $f = 0$ or $c_N \neq 0$ for some $n$ and $c_n - 0$ for $n < N$.
Therefore,
$$f(z) = \sum_{n \ge N}^\infty c_n(z - z_0)^n = (z - z_0)^N \left( \sum_{m = 0}^\infty c_{N + m} (z - z_0)^m \right) = (z - z_0)^N u(z)$$
Furthermore, $u(z_0) = c_N \neq 0$ so there exists a neighborhood of
$z_0$ on which $n(z) \neq 0$.

Let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic (and not identically
zero) then the set of zeros, $f^{-1}(0)$ is discrete.

Let $f$ vanish at $z_0$. If $f$ were identically zero on some open
neighborhood of $z_0$ then $f$ would be identically zero on $\Omega$.
Thus, by the lemma, we can write $f = (z - z_0)^n u(z)$ on some open
neighborhood $U$ of $z_0$ where $u(z)$ is nonvanishing on $U$.
Furthermore, $(z - z_0)^n$ vanishes exactly at $z_0$ so we have
$f^{-1}(0) \cap U = \{ z_0 \}$ implying that $f^{-1}(0)$ is discrete.

Let $f$ be a nonconstant holomorphic function. Then on any bounded set
$f$ has finitely many zeros.

Every bounded entire[^1] function is constant.

Let $f : \mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ be entire and bounded everywhere by
$M$. Take $w \in \mathbb{C}$ and let $C$ be a circle arround $z$ with
radius $R$. Then applying the Cauchy integral formula,
$$f'(w) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{(z - w)^2} \: \mathrm{d}z \: = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{f(w + R e^{i \theta})}{R^2 e^{2 i \theta}} R \: \mathrm{d}\theta \:$$
Therefore,
$$|f'(w)| = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \left| \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{(z - w)^2} \: \mathrm{d}z \: \right| \le \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{|f(w + R e^{i \theta})|}{R^2} R \: \mathrm{d}\theta \: \le \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{M}{R} \: \mathrm{d}\theta \: = \frac{M}{R}$$
which goes to zero in the limit $R \to \infty$. Since $R$ is arbitrarily
large, $f'(w) = 0$ so $f$ is constant since it has zero derivative
everywhere.

Meromorphic Functions
---------------------

A function $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ is meromorphic if, near any
$z_0 \in \Omega$, it can be written as,
$$f(z) = \sum_{n \ge - N} c_n (z - z_0)^n$$ We call $N$ the order of the
pole (assuming that $c_n \neq 0$) and $c_{-1}$ the residue at $z_0$.
This expansion shows that $f$ must have isolated poles and zeros.

Meromorphic functions $h : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ are exactly ratios of
holomorphic functions, $$h(z) = \frac{f(z)}{g(z)}$$ Since $g$ is
holomorphic it has isolated zeros and thus $h$ has isolated poles.

Let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ be meromorphic and
$D \subset \overline{D} \subset \Omega$ be a domain in $\Omega$ with
piecewise smooth boundary $\partial D$ such that no poles of $g$ lie on
$\partial D$. Then,
$$\oint_{\partial D} f(z) \: \mathrm{d}z \: = 2 \pi i  \sum_{p \in D} \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f$$

We can deform the path $\partial D$ to a sum of small circles of radius
$r$ surrounding each pole. Since $f$ is holomorphic on the region $D$
minus these circles the two integrals along these paths (whose
difference is the integral over the boundary) are equal. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
\oint_{\partial D} f(z) \: \mathrm{d}z \: - 2 \pi i \sum_{p \in D} \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f & = \sum_{p \in D} \left[ \oint_{\partial B_r(p)}  f(p + z) \: \mathrm{d}z \:  - 2 \pi i \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f   \right]
\\
& = \sum_{p \in D} \left[ \int_0^{2\pi} i \bigg( f(p + r e^{i\theta}) r e^{i \theta}  - \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f \bigg) \: \mathrm{d}\theta \:   \right]\end{aligned}$$
However,
$$\mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f = \lim_{z \to p} (z - p) f(z) = \lim_{h \to 0} f(p + h) h$$
and thus, for each $\epsilon > 0$ we can choose some $\delta$ such that
$r < \delta$ implies that,
$$\left| f(z + r r^{i \theta}) r e^{i \theta} - \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f \right| < \epsilon$$
Therefore, $$\begin{aligned}
\left| \oint_{\partial D} f(z) \: \mathrm{d}z \: - 2 \pi i \sum_{p \in D} \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f \right| & \le \sum_{p \in D} \left[ \int_0^{2\pi} \Big| f(p + r e^{i\theta}) r e^{i \theta}  - \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: g \Big| \: \mathrm{d}\theta \:   \right]
\\
\le \sum_{p \in D} \int_0^{2 \pi} \epsilon = 2 \pi N \epsilon \end{aligned}$$
where $N$ is the number of poles. Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary,
$$\oint_{\partial D} f(z) \: \mathrm{d}z \: = 2 \pi i \sum_{p \in D} \mathrm{Res}_{p} \: f$$

Let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ be meromorphic and
$D \subset \overline{D} \subset \Omega$ be a domain in $\Omega$ with
piecewise smooth boundary $\partial D$ such that no poles of $g$ lie on
$\partial D$. Then,
$$\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\partial D} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} \: \mathrm{d}z \: = \text{(\# of zeros)} - \text{(\# of poles)}$$

At each point $p \in D$ we can expand, $$f(z) = (z - p)^N u(z)$$ where
$u$ is holomorphic and nonvanishing. Therefore,
$$\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} = \frac{\: \mathrm{d} \:}{\: \mathrm{d}z \:} \log{f(z)} = \frac{\: \mathrm{d} \:}{\: \mathrm{d}z \:} \left[ (z - p)^N u(z) \right] = \frac{N}{x - p} + \frac{u'(z)}{u(z)}$$
Thus when $f$ has either a zero ($N > 0$) or a pole ($N < 0$) the
logarithmic derivative has residue,
$$\mathrm{Res}_{p} \: \left(\frac{f'}{f}\right) = N$$ Therefore the
result holds by the residue theorem.

Let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic take $w \in \mathbb{C}$,
then the number of solutions in $D$ to the equation $f(z) - w = 0$ is
equal to,
$$\#\{ z \in D \mid f(z) = w \} = \oint_{\partial D} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z) - w} \: \mathrm{d}z \:$$

Since $f - w$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$ is has no poles. Therefore, the
only residues are from roots of $f - w$ i.e. solutions to
$f(z) - w = 0$. As above, the integral of the logarithmic derivative
counts the number of such poles.
